# CSharp Guidelines Analyzer

This Visual Studio analyzer supports you in making your code comply with the C# coding guidelines at [CSharpGuidelines](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/CSharpGuidelines). Note that many guidelines are already covered by [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), which are not implemented here.

**Note:** This is still a very preliminary version, but work is in progress...
