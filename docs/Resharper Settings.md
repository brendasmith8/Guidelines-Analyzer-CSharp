# Resharper settings

Many guidelines are covered by Resharper. To verify those, this repository contains a special DotSettings file. 
You can easily use it in combination with your own Resharper settings, by adding it as a layer. That way, your existing preferences are merged with it.

To try it out, follow the next steps:
* Open your solution in Visual Studio
* Go to **Resharper**, **Manage Options**
* At the level **Solution team-shared**, click the green plus next to it and select **Open Settings File**
* Download and browse to [CSharpGuidelines.Layer.DotSettings](https://github.com/bkoelman/CSharpGuidelinesAnalyzer/blob/master/CSharpGuidelines.Layer.DotSettings)
* Click **Close** to save changes
